                    My name Joonas. Also known as KlopZ. I am an occasional sysadmin and a cybersecurity enthusiast. I have spent most of my time developing e-sports communities in Estonia but more recently I returned to learning more about DevOps and CyberSec.

                    Regarding cybersecurity I have experience in pentesting Active Directories, wide range of knowledge about social engineering attacks, WLAN attacks and other network vulnerabilities. I am also passionate about automating daily tasks, both software and hardware related, intrested in open-source operating systems like Linux and fond of reverse engineering hardware and software. I have done most of my projects with Python but I have also worked with HTML, CSS, SQL, C#, JavaScript and Bash. I also have fundamental knowledge about C++ and Rust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always had the will to develope the e-sports scene and cybersecurity in Estonia, coming up with ideas to improve CyberSec, educating others to be more secure on the internet and solving problems related to cybersecurity and privacy awareness.
