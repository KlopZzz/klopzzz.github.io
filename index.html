                    My name Joonas. Also known as KlopZ. I am an occasional sysadmin and a cybersecurity enthusiast. I have spent most of my time developing e-sports communities in Estonia but more recently I returned to learning more about system administration and cybersecurity.

                <p>
                    I always had the will to develope the e-sports scene and cybersecurity in Estonia, coming up with ideas to improve CyberSec, educating others to be more secure on the internet and solving problems related to cybersecurity and privacy awareness.
